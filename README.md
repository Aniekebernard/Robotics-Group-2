# Motion Detector Alarm System (Robotics Group 2)

This repository contains the source codes, simulation files, and PCB design files for a motion detector alarm system developed using an Arduino Uno and PIR motion sensor.

## Project Overview
The system detects motion within a monitored area and triggers visual and audible alerts using LEDs and a buzzer. The project was simulated using Proteus and Tinkercad and later implemented on a custom PCB designed in EasyEDA.
